# biggest_pathsum

Exercice 2 :
Given a matrix, beginning from (0,0), and assuming that you can move to the bottom and to the right to arrive to (n,n). Can you find a path to maximize the sum of the element on the matrix ? For instance :
  1, 2, 3
  1, 2, 5
  3, 4, 5
  
  => 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 16 !
